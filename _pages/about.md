If you've found this... my website is currently being created! Contact information and [CV](https://rrosener.github.io/cv/) are up to date. Stay tuned.



Introduction
------
Hi, I'm Riley Rosener! I recently graduated from the University of Chicago with a B.S. in Astrophysics with Honors, and a Minor in History. I am currently working as an researcher in [Professor Jacob Bean's research group](https://astro.uchicago.edu/~jbean/index.html), with Dr. Michael Zhang, transferring my senior thesis project into a paper manuscript for publication soon. More information can be found at [Publications](https://rrosener.github.io/publications/). 

Interests
------
My manuscript in preparation focuses on escaping exoplanet atmospheres, attempting to determine the detectability of potential outflow emissions. I am interested in observational astronomy and instrumentation, particularly within the field of exoplanets. I enjoy solving practical problems, and like engaging with astronomical data (and the associated problems with it). I am also curious about the intersection of astrophysics and the earth sciences, which is particularly relevant when studying the formation and evolution of planets.

Besides the above, I am also a big fan of all forms of science fiction, TTRPGs, amateur astronomy (as a hobby), and the history of various historical periods such as Renaissance Italy.
