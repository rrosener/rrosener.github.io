If you've found this... my website is currently being created! Contact information and [CV](https://rrosener.github.io/cv/) are up to date. Stay tuned.



Introduction
------
Hi, I'm Riley Rosener! I recently graduated from the University of Chicago with a B.S. in Astrophysics with Honors, and a Minor in History. I will be doing a Master's in Physics at the Université de Montréal, continuing my work in exoplanets. I recently worked as an researcher in [Professor Jacob Bean's research group](https://astro.uchicago.edu/~jbean/index.html), with Dr. Michael Zhang. I just published my [first first author paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada6ab) in _The Astrophysical Journal_. More details can be found at [Publications](https://rrosener.github.io/publications/) or by looking at the [GitHub page for pyTPCI](https://github.com/ideasrule/pyTPCI).

Interests
------
My first paper focuses on escaping exoplanet atmospheres, attempting to determine the detectability of potential outflow emissions. I am interested in observational astronomy and instrumentation, particularly within the field of exoplanets. I enjoy solving practical problems, and like engaging with astronomical data (and the associated problems with it). I am also curious about the intersection of astrophysics and the earth sciences, which is particularly relevant when studying the formation and evolution of planets.

Besides the above, I am also a big fan of all forms of science fiction, TTRPGs, amateur astronomy (as a hobby), and the history of various historical periods such as Renaissance Italy.
